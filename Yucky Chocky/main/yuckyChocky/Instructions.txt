Run using a shell window (terminal in Linux):

Open console (terminal in linux and macOS)

Navigate to main folder


Compile the following code: 
javac *.java


Run the Code:
java yuckyChocky


A new window will appear where the game can be played.







HOW TO USE:

When the game starts, a window will appear.

The window will prompt you to click one of the buttons.
Each button starts the game with different sized Chocolate bars.

Once the game starts, you get to play your turn first. 

Select a chocolate square from one of the four outer regions: 
1) First row (excluding the soap). 
	Chocolate breaking: bottom and right
2) Last row
	Chocolate breaking: top and right
3) First column (excluding the soap)
	Chocolate breaking: right and bottom
4) Last column
	Chocolate breaking: left and botton


Therefore you can only break the chocolate from the outer areas of the bar.

Once a square is selected, the chocolate is broken across.

Wait one sec as the computer decided which chocolate bar to break.

Once the computer has decided, the bar will be broken and it will be stated at the bottom as to which bar the computer had selected.

Think tactically and try to be the player who is not left with the soap at the end. 

If you manage to eat all chocolates and keep only the soap for the computer, YOU WIN!!
